# Validation Rules

pgdesign's validator checks schemas for errors and warnings. Errors block DDL generation; warnings are advisory. Rules can be disabled individually via `pgdesign.toml`.

## Error rules

Errors indicate problems that must be fixed.

### E200: Missing column type

A column has no PG type after type resolution. This usually means the column references an undefined semantic type.

```toml
[tables.users.columns.name]
type = "nonexistent_type"  # E200: column missing type
```

### E201: FK missing ON DELETE

Every foreign key must declare an `on_delete` clause.

```toml
[tables.posts.fks.fk_posts_author]
columns = ["author_id"]
ref_table = "users"
ref_columns = ["id"]
# E201: missing on_delete
```

**Fix:** Add `on_delete = "CASCADE"`, `"RESTRICT"`, `"SET NULL"`, or `"NO ACTION"`.

### E202: Table missing comment

Every table must have a `comment` field.

```toml
[tables.users]
# E202: table missing comment

[tables.users.columns.id]
type = "id"
```

**Fix:** Add `comment = "Description of this table"`.

### E203: Table missing primary key

Every table must have a primary key. Tables with an `id` or `auto_id` typed column get a PK inferred automatically.

```toml
[tables.logs]
comment = "Application logs"

[tables.logs.columns.message]
type = "short_text"
# E203: no pk defined and no id column
```

**Fix:** Add `pk = ["column"]` to the table definition.

### E204: FK references non-existent target

A foreign key references a table or column that does not exist in the schema.

```toml
[tables.posts.fks.fk_posts_category]
columns = ["category_id"]
ref_table = "categories"  # E204 if categories table not defined
ref_columns = ["id"]
on_delete = "RESTRICT"
```

### E206: Duplicate index

An index's columns are an exact prefix of another index on the same table.

### E207: varchar usage

`varchar` or `character varying` is used instead of `text`. pgdesign enforces `text` with `CHECK` constraints for length limits.

```toml
# Don't do this -- use short_text or text with check instead
[tables.users.columns.name]
type = "scalar"  # with base_type = "varchar(255)"
```

**Fix:** Use `text` with a `CHECK(LENGTH(col) <= N)` constraint, or the `short_text` built-in type.

### E208: timestamp without time zone

`timestamp` (without time zone) is used instead of `timestamptz`. Always use `timestamptz` to avoid timezone ambiguity.

**Fix:** Use the `timestamp` or `timestamp_optional` semantic types, or `timestamptz` as a raw base type.

### E209: serial usage

`serial` or `bigserial` is used. These are legacy PostgreSQL types.

**Fix:** Use the `auto_id` semantic type (which uses `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`) or the `id` type (UUID).

### E210: float for money

A `float`, `real`, or `double precision` type is used on a column with a money-related name (price, cost, amount, balance, total, fee). Floating-point types cause rounding errors with monetary values.

**Fix:** Use the `money` semantic type (bigint in minor units) or `numeric(precision, scale)`.

### E211: Naming convention violation

Table, column, or index names do not match the `snake_case` pattern (`^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*$`).

### E212: FK columns missing index

FK columns have no covering index. Without an index, joins and cascaded deletes perform full table scans.

```toml
[tables.posts.fks.fk_posts_author]
columns = ["author_id"]
ref_table = "users"
ref_columns = ["id"]
on_delete = "CASCADE"
# E212: add an index on (author_id)
```

**Fix:** Add an index on the FK columns.

### E213: Generated column references generated column

A generated column's expression references another generated column. PostgreSQL does not allow this.

```toml
[tables.orders.columns.subtotal]
type = "money"
generated = "quantity * unit_price"
stored = true

[tables.orders.columns.total]
type = "money"
generated = "subtotal + tax"  # E213: references generated column subtotal
stored = true
```

**Fix:** Only reference non-generated columns in generated expressions.

### E214: Opclass requires undeclared extension

An index uses an operator class (e.g., `gin_trgm_ops`) that requires a PostgreSQL extension not listed in `[meta].extensions`.

**Fix:** Add the extension to `extensions = ["pg_trgm"]` in the `[meta]` section.

### E215: RLS policy expression mismatch

A row-level security policy uses the wrong expression type for its operation:
- INSERT policies should use `with_check`, not `using`
- SELECT and DELETE policies cannot use `with_check`
- UPDATE and ALL can use both

## Warning rules

Warnings highlight potential design issues but do not block DDL generation.

### W001: God table

A table has more columns than the configured maximum (default: 30). This suggests the table is doing too much and should be decomposed.

**Suggestion:** Split into smaller, focused tables with foreign key relationships.

### W002: Orphan table

A table has no FK relationships at all -- it neither references nor is referenced by any other table. This may indicate a missing relationship or an unused table.

### W003: Boolean state machine

A table has 3 or more boolean columns. Multiple boolean flags often indicate a state machine that would be better modeled as an enum column.

```toml
# W003: is_active, is_verified, is_suspended suggest a status enum
[tables.users.columns.is_active]
type = "flag"

[tables.users.columns.is_verified]
type = "flag"

[tables.users.columns.is_suspended]
type = "flag"
```

**Suggestion:** Replace with `type = "status"` using an enum type like `values = ["active", "verified", "suspended"]`.

### W004: JSON array could be a table

A jsonb column with a plural name and an empty array default (`'[]'::jsonb`) may be storing data that belongs in a normalized table.

**Suggestion:** Create a separate table with a foreign key instead of embedding a JSON array.

### W005: Missing created_at

A non-junction table (more than 2 columns) lacks a `created_at` column. Most tables benefit from tracking when rows were created.

### W006: char(n) usage

`char(n)` is used instead of `text`. In PostgreSQL, `char(n)` pads with spaces and offers no performance benefit over `text`.

### W007: Redundant index

An index's columns are a leading prefix of another index using the same method. The shorter index is redundant because the longer one handles the same queries.

### W008: Circular FK dependency

Tables have circular foreign key references (A references B, B references A). pgdesign handles this by creating tables without the FK first, then adding the FK via `ALTER TABLE`, but it may indicate a design issue.

### W009: Policy error_code not snake_case

An RLS policy's `error_code` field does not follow snake_case naming.

## Normal form audit warnings

These are emitted by `pgdesign audit`, not `pgdesign validate`. They require functional dependencies to be declared on the table.

### W100: 1NF violation (repeating group)

A jsonb column with a plural name, list-like name, or `'[]'::jsonb` default may contain repeating groups, violating first normal form.

### W101: 2NF violation (partial dependency)

A non-prime attribute depends on a proper subset of a composite candidate key. This means the column belongs in a separate table keyed by that subset.

```toml
[tables.enrollments]
comment = "Student enrollments"
pk = ["student_id", "course_id"]

[tables.enrollments.columns.student_name]
type = "short_text"
# W101: student_name depends only on student_id, not the full PK

[[tables.enrollments.dependencies]]
determinant = ["student_id"]
dependent = ["student_name"]
```

### W102: 3NF violation (transitive dependency)

A non-prime attribute is determined by a non-superkey. This means there is a transitive dependency that should be extracted into a separate table.

When a 3NF violation is detected, pgdesign suggests a decomposition using Bernstein's synthesis algorithm.

## Disabling rules

Disable rules by code in `pgdesign.toml`:

```toml
[validate]
disable = ["W002", "W005", "W006"]
```

This skips the disabled rules during `pgdesign validate`. The codes apply to the validation rules (E2xx, W00x). Audit warnings (W1xx) are controlled separately via `pgdesign audit`.
